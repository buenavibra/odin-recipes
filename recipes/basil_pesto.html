    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can sub half the basil leaves with
        baby spinach)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup pine nuts (can sub chopped walnuts)</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pulse the basil and pine nuts: Place the basil leaves and pine nuts into
        the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic and cheese: Add the garlic and Parmesan or Romano cheese
        and pulse several times more. Scrape down the sides of the food
        processor with a rubber spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly pour in the olive oil: While the food processor is running,
        slowly add the olive oil in a steady small stream. Adding the olive oil
        slowly while the processor is running will help it emulsify and help
        keep the olive oil from separating. Occasionally, stop to scrape down
        the sides of the food processor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the pesto sauce: Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to
        taste. Toss with pasta for a quick sauce, dollop over baked potatoes, or
        spread onto crackers or toasted slices of bread.
      </li>
    </ol>
